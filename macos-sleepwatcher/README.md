# Sleepwatcher Scripts

Like everything else in this repo, use `stow` to create symlinks in your home directory.

Relies on the Homebrew package `Sleepwatcher` which will run the scripts before and after sleep.
Right now we turn bluetooth off during sleep because if it's left on it prevents the mac from staying asleep.
