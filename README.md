# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. To use them do the following:

1. Clone this repo into your home directory:

```
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:taylorsilva/dotfiles.git
```

2. Make sure `GNU stow` is installed:

```
# Mac
brew install stow

sudo apt install stow
```

3. Use `stow <dir>` to symlink the contents of each folder to your home directory
